For many of us, exploring the space designates the insatiable quest to expand our horizon in terms of planets and life forms. We neglect the fact that many of our planet's mysteries remain unveiled to our knowledge. We forget to search for the enigmas that render our planet outstanding and unpredictable. By providing an observation and work area in the International Space Station, the Cupola module allows external viewing of Earth and distant celestial objects.

Cupola.me is a multiplayer game that allows players to compete against each other by guessing the corect location of satelites pictures of the earth. The closer you are to the target, the more points you earn.
